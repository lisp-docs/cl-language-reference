**sequence** *System Class* 



**Class Precedence List:** 



**sequence**, **t** 



**Description:** 



*Sequences* are ordered collections of *objects*, called the *elements* of the *sequence*. 



The *types* **vector** and the *type* **list** are *disjoint subtypes* of *type* **sequence**, but are not necessarily an *exhaustive partition* of *sequence*. 



When viewing a *vector* as a *sequence*, only the *active elements* of that *vector* are considered *elements* of the *sequence*; that is, *sequence* operations respect the *fill pointer* when given *sequences* represented as *vectors*.
