 



One function, **sleep**, takes its argument as a non-negative *real* number of seconds. Informally, it may be useful to think of this as a *relative universal time*, but it differs in one important way: *universal times* are always non-negative *integers*, whereas the argument to **sleep** can be any kind of non-negative *real*, in order to allow for the possibility of fractional seconds.
