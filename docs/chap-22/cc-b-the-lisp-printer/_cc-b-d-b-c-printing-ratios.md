The numerator and denominator are both printed in the radix specified by the *current output base*; they are obtained as if by **numerator** and **denominator**, and so *ratios* are printed in reduced form (lowest terms). If appropriate, a radix specifier can be printed; see 

**\*print-radix\***. If the ratio is negative, a minus sign is printed before the numerator. For related information about the syntax of a *ratio*, see Section 2.3.2.1.2 (Syntax of a Ratio).
