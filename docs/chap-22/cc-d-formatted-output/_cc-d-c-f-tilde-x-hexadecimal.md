 



This is just like ~D but prints in hexadecimal radix (radix 16) instead of decimal. The full form is therefore ~*mincol*,*padchar*,*commachar*,*comma-interval*X. 



~X binds **\*print-escape\*** to *false*, **\*print-radix\*** to *false*, **\*print-base\*** to 16, and **\*print-readably\*** to *false*.
