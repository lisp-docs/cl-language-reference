Note that the meaning of **nil** and **t** as destinations to **format** are different than those of **nil** and **t** as *stream designators*. 

The ~\<i\>\<sup\>∧\</sup\>\</i\> should appear only at the beginning of a ~\< clause, because it aborts the entire clause in which it appears (as well as all following clauses).
