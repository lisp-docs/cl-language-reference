 



A *binding* is an association between a *name* and that which the name denotes. *Bindings* are *established* in a *lexical environment* or a *dynamic environment* by particular *special operators*. 



An *environment* is a set of *bindings* and other information used during evaluation (*e.g.*, to associate meanings with names). 



*Bindings* in an *environment* are partitioned into *namespaces*. A single *name* can simultaneously have more than one associated *binding* per *environment*, but can have only one associated *binding* per *namespace*.
