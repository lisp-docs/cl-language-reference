 



In a number of situations, a *documentation string* can appear amidst a series of **declare** *expressions* prior to a series of *forms*. 



In that case, if a *string S* appears where a *documentation string* is permissible and is not followed by either a **declare** *expression* or a *form* then *S* is taken to be a *form*; otherwise, *S* is taken as a *documentation string*. The consequences are unspecified if more than one such *documentation string* is present.
