If optional parameters are specified, then each one is processed as follows. If any unprocessed arguments remain, then the parameter variable *var* is bound to the next remaining argument, just as for a required parameter. If no arguments remain, however, then *init-form* is evaluated, and the parameter variable is bound to the resulting value (or to **nil** if no *init-form* appears in the parameter specifier). If another variable name *supplied-p-parameter* appears in the specifier, it is bound to *true* if an argument had been available, and to *false* if no argument remained (and therefore *init-form* had to be evaluated). *Supplied-p-parameter* is bound not to an argument but to a value indicating whether or not an argument had been supplied for the corresponding *var*.
