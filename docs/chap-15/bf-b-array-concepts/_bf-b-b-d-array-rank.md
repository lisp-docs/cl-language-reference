**15.1.1.3 Array Rank** 

An *array* can have any number of *dimensions* (including zero). The number of *dimensions* is called the *rank*. 

If the rank of an *array* is zero then the *array* is said to have no *dimensions*, and the product of the dimensions (see **array-total-size**) is then 1; a zero-rank *array* therefore has a single element.
