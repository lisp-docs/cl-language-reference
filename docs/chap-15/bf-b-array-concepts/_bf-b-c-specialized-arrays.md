 



An *array* can be a *general array*, meaning each *element* may be any *object*, or it may be a *specialized array*, meaning that each *element* must be of a restricted *type*. 



The phrasing “an *array specialized* to *type hhtype⟩” is sometimes used to emphasize the *element type* of an *array*. This phrasing is tolerated even when the ⟨type⟩ is **t**, even though an *array specialized* to *type t* is a *general array*, not a *specialized array*. 



Figure 15–1 lists some *defined names* that are applicable to *array* creation, *access*, and information operations.
