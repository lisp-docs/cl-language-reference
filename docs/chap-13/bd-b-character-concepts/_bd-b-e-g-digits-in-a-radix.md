**13.1.4.6 Digits in a Radix** 

What qualifies as a *digit* depends on the *radix* (an *integer* between 2 and 36, inclusive). The potential *digits* are: 

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 

Their respective weights are 0, 1, 2, *. . .* 35. In any given radix *n*, only the first *n* potential *digits* are considered to be *digits*. For example, the digits in radix 2 are 0 and 1, the digits in radix 10 are 0 through 9, and the digits in radix 16 are 0 through F. 

*Case* is not significant in *digits*; for example, in radix 16, both F and f are *digits* with weight 15.
