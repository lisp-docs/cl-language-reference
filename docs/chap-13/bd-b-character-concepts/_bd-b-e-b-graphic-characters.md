**13.1.4.1 Graphic Characters** 

*Characters* that are classified as *graphic*, or displayable, are each associated with a glyph, a visual representation of the *character* . 

A *graphic character* is one that has a standard textual representation as a single *glyph*, such as A or \* or =. *Space*, which effectively has a blank *glyph*, is defined to be a *graphic*. 

Of the *standard characters*, *newline* is *non-graphic* and all others are *graphic*; see Section 2.1.3 (Standard Characters). 

*Characters* that are not *graphic* are called *non-graphic*. *Non-graphic characters* are sometimes informally called “formatting characters” or “control characters.” 

#\Backspace, #\Tab, #\Rubout, #\Linefeed, #\Return, and #\Page, if they are supported by the *implementation*, are *non-graphic*.
