 



There are several (overlapping) categories of *characters* that have no formally associated *type* but that are nevertheless useful to name. They include *graphic characters*, *alphabetic*<sub>1</sub> *characters*, *characters* with *case* (*uppercase* and *lowercase characters*), *numeric characters*, *alphanumeric characters*, and *digits* (in a given *radix* ). 



For each *implementation-defined attribute* of a *character* , the documentation for that *implementa tion* must specify whether *characters* that differ only in that *attribute* are permitted to differ in whether are not they are members of one of the aforementioned categories. 



Note that these terms are defined independently of any special syntax which might have been enabled in the *current readtable*.
