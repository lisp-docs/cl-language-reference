 



The if and when constructs take one *form* as a test and a clause that is executed when the test *yields true*. The clause can be a value accumulation, unconditional, or another conditional clause; it can also be any combination of such clauses connected by the **loop** and keyword. 



The **loop** unless construct is similar to the **loop** when construct except that it complements the test result. 



The **loop** else construct provides an optional component of if, when, and unless clauses that is executed when an if or when test *yields false* or when an unless test *yields true*. The component is one of the clauses described under if. 



The **loop** end construct provides an optional component to mark the end of a conditional clause. For more information, see Section 6.1.6 (Conditional Execution Clauses).
