 



An “abbreviating” *type specifier* is one that describes a *subtype* for which it is in principle possible to enumerate the *elements*, but for which in practice it is impractical to do so. 



A “specializing” *type specifier* is one that describes a *subtype* by restricting the *type* of one or more components of the *type*, such as *element type* or *complex part type*. 



A “predicating” *type specifier* is one that describes a *subtype* containing only those *objects* that satisfy a given *predicate*. 



A “combining” *type specifier* is one that describes a *subtype* in a compositional way, using combining operations (such as “and,” “or,” and “not”) on other *types*.
