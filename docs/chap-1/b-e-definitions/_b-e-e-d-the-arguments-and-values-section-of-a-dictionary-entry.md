 



An English language description of what *arguments* the *operator* accepts and what *values* it returns, including information about defaults for *parameters* corresponding to omittable *arguments* (such as *optional parameters* and *keyword parameters*). For *special operators* and *macros*, their *arguments* are not *evaluated* unless it is explicitly stated in their descriptions that they are *evaluated*. 



Except as explicitly specified otherwise, the consequences are undefined if these type restrictions are violated.
