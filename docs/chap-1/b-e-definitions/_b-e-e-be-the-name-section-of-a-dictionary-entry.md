 

This section introduces the dictionary entry. It is not explicitly labeled. It appears preceded and followed by a horizontal bar. 

In large print at left, the *defined name* appears; if more than one *defined name* is to be described by the entry, all such *names* are shown separated by commas. 

In somewhat smaller italic print at right is an indication of what kind of dictionary entry this is. Possible values are: 

*Accessor* 

This is an *accessor function*. 

*Class* 

This is a *class*. 





*Condition Type* 

This is a *subtype* of *type* **condition**. 

*Constant Variable* 

This is a *constant variable*. 

*Declaration* 

This is a *declaration identifier* . 

*Function* 

This is a *function*. 

*Local Function* 

This is a *function* that is defined only lexically within the scope of some other *macro form*. 

*Local Macro* 

This is a *macro* that is defined only lexically within the scope of some other *macro form*. 

*Macro* 

This is a *macro*. 

*Restart* 

This is a *restart*. 

*Special Operator* 

This is a *special operator* . 

*Standard Generic Function* 

This is a *standard generic function*. 

*Symbol* 

This is a *symbol* that is specially recognized in some particular situation, such as the syntax of a *macro*. 

*System Class* 

This is like *class*, but it identifies a *class* that is potentially a *built-in class*. (No *class* is actually required to be a *built-in class*.)  



*Type* 

This is an *atomic type specifier* , and depending on information for each particular entry, may subject to form other *type specifiers*. 

*Type Specifier* 

This is a *defined name* that is not an *atomic type specifier* , but that can be used in constructing valid *type specifiers*. 

*Variable* 

This is a *dynamic variable*.
