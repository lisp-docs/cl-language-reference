 

Deprecated language features are not expected to appear in future Common Lisp standards, but are required to be implemented for conformance with this standard; see Section 1.5.1.1 (Required Language Features). 

*Conforming programs* can use deprecated features; however, it is considered good programming style to avoid them. It is permissible for the compiler to produce *style warnings* about the use of such features at compile time, but there should be no such warnings at program execution time.
