 



Suppose that function foo is a member of a set *S* of *functions* that operate on numbers. Suppose that one passage states that an error must be signaled if any *function* in *S* is ever given an argument of 17. Suppose that an apparently conflicting passage states that the consequences are undefined if foo receives an argument of 17. Then the second passage (the one specifically about foo) would dominate because the description of the situational context is the most specific, and it would not be required that foo signal an error on an argument of 17 even though other functions in the set *S* would be required to do so.
