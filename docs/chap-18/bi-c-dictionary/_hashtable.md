**hash-table** *System Class* 



**Class Precedence List:** 



**hash-table**, **t** 



**Description:** 



*Hash tables* provide a way of mapping any *object* (a *key*) to an associated *object* (a *value*). 



**See Also:** 



Section 18.1 (Hash Table Concepts), Section 22.1.3.13 (Printing Other Objects) 



**Notes:** 



The intent is that this mapping be implemented by a hashing mechanism, such as that described in Section 6.4 “Hashing” of *The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 3* (pp506-549). In spite of this intent, no *conforming implementation* is required to use any particular technique to implement the mapping.
