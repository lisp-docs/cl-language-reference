**boolean** *Type* 



**Supertypes:** 



**boolean**, **symbol**, **t** 



**Description:** 



The *type* **boolean** contains the *symbols* **t** and **nil**, which represent true and false, respectively. 



**See Also:** 



**t** (*constant variable*), **nil** (*constant variable*), **if**, **not**, **complement** 



**Notes:** 



Conditional operations, such as **if**, permit the use of *generalized booleans*, not just *booleans*; any *non-nil* value, not just **t**, counts as true for a *generalized boolean*. However, as a matter of convention, the *symbol* **t** is considered the canonical value to use even for a *generalized boolean* when no better choice presents itself.
