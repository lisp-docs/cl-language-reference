**2.1.4.1 Constituent Characters** 

*Constituent characters* are used in *tokens*. A *token* is a representation of a *number* or a *symbol*. Examples of *constituent characters* are letters and digits. 

Letters in symbol names are sometimes converted to letters in the opposite *case* when the name is read; see Section 23.1.2 (Effect of Readtable Case on the Lisp Reader). *Case* conversion can be suppressed by the use of *single escape* or *multiple escape* characters.
