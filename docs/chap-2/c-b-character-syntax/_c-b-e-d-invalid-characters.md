 



*Characters* with the *constituent trait invalid* cannot ever appear in a *token* except under the control of a *single escape character* . If an *invalid character* is encountered while an *object* is being read, an error of *type* **reader-error** is signaled. If an *invalid character* is preceded by a *single escape character* , it is treated as an *alphabetic*<sub>2</sub> *constituent* instead.
