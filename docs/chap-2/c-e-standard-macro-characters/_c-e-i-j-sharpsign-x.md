 



#X*rational* reads *rational* in hexadecimal (radix 16). The digits above 9 are the letters A through F (the lowercase letters a through f are also acceptable). For example, 



#xF00 *≡* 3840 



#x105 *≡* 261 ;105<sub>16</sub> 



The consequences are undefined if the token immediately following the #X does not have the syntax of a hexadecimal (*i.e.*, radix 16) *rational*.
