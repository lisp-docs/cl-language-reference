 



A subclass inherits methods in the sense that any method applicable to all instances of a class is also applicable to all instances of any subclass of that class. 



The inheritance of methods acts the same way regardless of which of the *method-defining operators* created the methods. 



The inheritance of methods is described in detail in Section 7.6.6 (Method Selection and Combination).
