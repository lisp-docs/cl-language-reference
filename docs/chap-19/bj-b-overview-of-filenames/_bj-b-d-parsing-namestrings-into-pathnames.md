 



Parsing is the operation used to convert a *namestring* into a *pathname*. Except in the case of parsing *logical pathname namestrings*, this operation is *implementation-dependent*, because the format of *namestrings* is *implementation-dependent*. 



A *conforming implementation* is free to accommodate other *file system* features in its *pathname* representation and provides a parser that can process such specifications in *namestrings*. *Conforming programs* must not depend on any such features, since those features will not be portable.
