 



As a *pathname* component value, **nil**represents that the component is “unfilled”; see Section 19.2.3 (Merging Pathnames). 



The value of any *pathname* component can be **nil**. 



When constructing a *pathname*, **nil** in the host component might mean a default host rather than an actual **nil** in some *implementations*.
