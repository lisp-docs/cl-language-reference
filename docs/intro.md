# Introduction

Welcome to the CL Technical Reference.

The goal of this project is to provide a full technical reference that can be useful to anyone programming in Common Lisp.

This document is comprised of both the original Common Lisp specification, and community-provided explanations and examples to make it easier to understand.

If you have any ideas, please help us with an issue on GitHub or better yet, make a pull request!

Thank you and we hope you find this useful.

Lisp Docs

:::tip
Some **Code Blocks** and **Tables** have not yet been changed to [Markdown Syntax](https://commonmark.org/help/), please help us fix the syntax whenever you notice text that needs to be fixed. Note that we use [MDX](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features) instead of vanilla markdown which means `<`, `>`, `{`, `}` are reserved and you can use React!
