# Introduction

Welcome to the CL Technical Reference.

The goal of this project is to provide a full technical reference that can be useful to anyone programming in Common Lisp.

This document is comprised of both the original Common Lisp specification, and community provided explanations and examples to make it easier to understand.

If you have any ideas, please help us with an issue on GitHub or better yet, make a pull request!

Thank you and we hope you find this useful.

:::tip
Some **Code Blocks** and **Tables** have not yet been chanegd to [Markdown Syntax](https://commonmark.org/help/), please help us fix the syntax whenever you notice text that needs to be fixed. Note that we use [MDX](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features) instead of vanilla markdown which means `<`, `>`, `{`, `}` are reserved and you can use React!
