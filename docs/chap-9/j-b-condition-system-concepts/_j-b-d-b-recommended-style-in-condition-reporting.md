 



In order to ensure a properly aesthetic result when presenting *report messages* to the user, certain stylistic conventions are recommended. 



There are stylistic recommendations for the content of the messages output by *condition reporters*, but there are no formal requirements on those *programs*. If a *program* violates the recommendations for some message, the display of that message might be less aesthetic than if the guideline had been observed, but the *program* is still considered a *conforming program*. 



The requirements on a *program* or *implementation* which invokes a *condition reporter* are somewhat stronger. A *conforming program* must be permitted to assume that if these style guidelines are followed, proper aesthetics will be maintained. Where appropriate, any specific requirements on such routines are explicitly mentioned below.
