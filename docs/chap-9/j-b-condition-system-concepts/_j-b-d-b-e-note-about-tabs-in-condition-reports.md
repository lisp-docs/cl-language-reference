**9.1.3.1.4 Note about Tabs in Condition Reports** 

Because the indentation of a *report message* might be shifted to the right or left by an arbitrary amount, special care should be taken with the semi-standard *character hTabi* (in those *implementations* that support such a *character* ). Unless the *implementation* specifically defines its behavior in this context, its use should be avoided.
