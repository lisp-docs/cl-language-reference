These files are Common Lisp ANSI Spec files, which means the actual content has to stay exactly as it is. 
The files are in MDX format and have custom React Components in them which should not be removed.
You are to fix formatting issues with this files related to:
- The markdown tables are often misformatted
- Sometimes there are new lines in the middle of a sentence
- Sometimes a new lines are missing
- Keep in mind that for bullet lists to show as separate lines, they need 2 new line characters
- Code is disperesed without it being surrounded by the code block or inline code format
- Code blocks should use quote characters instead of backticks. Inline code however, which only uses one backtick, can still use one backtick.
- The default language for code blocks is `lisp`
- Do not add any of the custom react component tags, and do not remove them either, just keep things as they are and focus on only fixing the markdown formatting issues
Keep in mind that sometimes there are no issues with the text and nothing needs to be changed.
